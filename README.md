# Membership Dues Estimator

This is a simple web tool for potential members to estimate their dues and see benefits. It uses no framework because it is intended to be dumped onto a Joomla page using the page editor thingy.

Integration strategy:
1. Open style.scss. Copy contents and paste into https://sassmeister.com. Copy output and dump into a `<style>` tag.
2. Open index.ts. Copy contents and paste into https://typescriptlang.org/play/. Copy output and dump into a `<script>` tag.
3. Open index.html. Copy contents and paste into your Joomla (or whatever) page.
4. Voil√†
